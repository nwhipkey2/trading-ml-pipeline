## Overview
This repository implements a macro-aware, cross-asset ML pipeline for
portfolio allocation and research.

The system:
- ingests multi-asset market and macro data
- engineers time-series and cross-sectional features
- trains panel models with walk-forward validation
- evaluates strategies using realistic, volatility-targeted backtests
- is fully containerized for reproducibility and distributed execution

This is a research system, not trading advice.
